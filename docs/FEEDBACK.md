## A Personal Note from the Developer

Hi, I'm Szymon - the sole developer behind GhostComm.

This project started in my small flat, born from a simple question: what if we could communicate without servers, without corporations watching, without leaving digital footprints? What began as late-night coding sessions fueled by too much coffee has evolved into something I never expected - a working mesh network that actually delivers on that promise.

## The Reality

I need to be transparent with you: GhostComm is an experiment in what's possible when one person decides to challenge the status quo. I'm not a tech giant with unlimited resources just a guy who works on an ironing board. I'm one developer with a vision, working nights and weekends, learning as I go, making mistakes, fixing them, and pushing forward.

Every line of code, every security decision, every UI element - it's all been crafted by one pair of hands. Mine. This means:

- **Updates take time** - I test everything personally before release
- **Features are prioritized** - I can only build so much at once
- **Bugs exist** - Despite my best efforts, I'm human
- **Response times vary** - I sleep occasionally (though my git history might suggest otherwise)

## Why Your Feedback Matters

When you send feedback, you're not talking to a customer service department or a bug triage team. You're talking directly to me - the person who wrote the code you're using. Your message lands in my inbox between debug sessions and protocol improvements.

Your feedback has already shaped GhostComm:
- The iBeacon discovery fallback? User suggestion.
- The 30-second timeout on fragments? Community feedback.
- Priority on battery optimization? You asked, I listened.

## How to Reach Me

**General Feedback & Ideas**: SzyYP@proton.me  
**Security Issues**: SzyYP@proton.me (PGP available - see SECURITY.md)  
**Bug Reports**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Szyyi/GhostCommV2/issues)  
**Community Discussion**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Szyyi/GhostCommV2/discussions)

## What Helps Most

**Be specific**: "Connection drops after 5 minutes on Pixel 7" is infinitely more helpful than "app doesn't work"

**Be patient**: I read everything, but I can only fix so much at once

**Be understanding**: This is v2.1 of an experimental mesh network. We're pioneering here.

**Be part of the journey**: Every user is essentially a beta tester helping shape something unique

## A Promise

I can't promise GhostComm will always work perfectly. I can't promise immediate fixes or that every feature request will be implemented. 

What I can promise is this: Every piece of feedback is read by the person who can actually do something about it. Every bug report makes the next version better. Every security concern is taken seriously.

This isn't just an app to me - it's proof that individuals can still build technology that serves users, not shareholders. It's a statement that privacy isn't optional. It's my contribution to a world that desperately needs alternatives to surveillance capitalism.

## The Dream

Maybe one day GhostComm will have a team. Maybe it'll become the standard for offline communication. Maybe it'll inspire others to build privacy-first technology.

Or maybe it'll remain one developer's stubborn insistence that we deserve better.

Either way, I'll keep coding. And your feedback will keep shaping what I build.

Thank you for being part of this experiment. Thank you for choosing privacy. Thank you for trusting code written by someone you've never met, working alone, trying to make a difference.

*P.S. - If you're a developer interested in contributing, reach out. This journey doesn't have to be solo forever.*

*P.P.S. - Yes, I know the UI needs work. It's on the list. Right after fixing that fragment reassembly edge case...*
